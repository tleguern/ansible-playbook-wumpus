# Ansible Playbook: Hunt the Wumpus

This project is an attempt at porting the old computer game `Hunt the Wumpus` written by Gregory Yob in 1973 to Ansible.
The work is still in progress.

Here is a list of intended features for first release:

- [X] Generate a random dodecahedron ;
- [X] Generate a random position for the bats ;
- [X] Generate a random position for the pits ;
- [X] Generate a random position for the Wumpus ;
- [X] Generate a not too unfair position for the player ;
- [X] Move around the map ;
- [X] Bats transport the player ;
- [X] Death by falling in a pit ;
- [X] Death by being eaten by the evil Wumpus ;
- [X] Death by firing the last arrow ;
- [X] Feeling nearby pits ;
- [X] Hearing nearby bats ;
- [X] Smelling nearby wumpii ;
- [X] Shoot arrows ;
- [X] Hard stop for arrows at 4 rooms ;
- [X] The Wumpus awakens and moves on shot failure ;

Features not fit for the first release:

- [ ] Random chances that the arrow fail after 3 rooms ;
- [ ] Difficulty selection ;
- [ ] Generation of different shapes of cave as in `Hunt the Wumpus II` ;
- [ ] Add _tumaeros_: anaerobic termite, arrows eaters ;
- [ ] The player can survive walking on a pit (1/6) ;
- [ ] The Wumpus can awaken and move on bumping walls (1/6) ;
- [ ] Bats can drop player on other bats.

## Caveats

- The game is not exactly comfortable to play, better play `wump(6)` directly.

## How to play

Simply run the following command:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook wumpus.yml
```

There are two possible actions: `move` to an adjacent room (be careful about bottomless pits, giant bats or the occasional Wumpus) or `shoot` a crooked arrow to a series of rooms.
