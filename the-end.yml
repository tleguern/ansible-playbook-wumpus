      *AAAUUUUGGGGGHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh...*
      The whistling sound and updraft as you walked into this room of the
      cave apparently weren't enough to clue you in to the presence of the
      bottomless pit. You have a lot of time to reflect on this error as
      you fall many miles to the core of the earth. Look on the bright side;
      you can at least find out if Jules Verne was right...

      *ROAR* *chomp* *snurfle* *chomp*!
      Much to the delight of the Wumpus, you walk right into his mouth,
      making you one of the easiest dinners he's ever had! For you, however,
      it's a rather unpleasant death. The only good thing is that it's been
      so long since the evil Wumpus cleaned his teeth that you immediately
      pass out from the stench!

      You turn and look at your quiver, and realize with a sinking feeling
      that you've just shot your last arrow (figuratively, too). Sensing this
      with its psychic powers, the evil Wumpus rampages through the cave, finds
      you, and with a mighty *ROAR* eats you alive!

      Thwack!*  A sudden piercing feeling informs you that your wild arrow
      has ricocheted back and wedged in your side, causing extreme agony. The
      evil Wumpus, with its psychic powers, realizes this and immediately rushes
      to your side, not to help, alas, but to EAT YOU!
      (*CHOMP*)

      A horrible roar fills the cave, and you realize, with a smile, that you
      have slain the evil Wumpus and won the game! You don't want to tarry for
      long, however, because not only is the Wumpus famous, but the stench of
      dead Wumpus is also quite well known--a stench powerful enough to slay the
      mightiest adventurer at a single whiff!!
